"""sand3d — the vocabulary an LLM writes 3D assets in.

    import sand3d as s3d

One flat surface: every verb is `s3d.<verb>`. Millimetres, unless the program
sets another unit with `s3d.units`; `export` scales to metres. A program records
`s3d.__version__`, `s3d.fingerprint()` and `s3d.units()` with what it built.
